RAG-Based AI Legal Assistant
Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Legal & Tax Advisory (Local, Offline Deployment)
Built with LangChain, FAISS, Ollama, Streamlit, SQLite, and secure user roles.

📌 Overview
This project is a local, privacy-focused AI Legal Assistant that allows users to ask natural-language questions about legal documents, tax laws, company policies, contracts, HR manuals, or any uploaded PDF.

It uses RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) to ensure answers come directly from your own documents, not from the model’s memory.

🔒 100% Local — No Cloud Required
Documents never leave your PC or LAN.
Powered by Ollama (local LLM) + LangChain pipeline.
👥 Multi-User System
Admin Panel: Upload documents, rebuild index, manage users, clear database, and view logs.
Client Panel: Ask questions through chat interface and receive grounded answers.
🚀 Features
🔹 Core Features
Upload legal PDFs and build a persistent FAISS vector index
Ask legal/tax/policy questions in natural language
Local LLM generates answers based on retrieved document chunks
Uses chunking, embeddings, vector similarity search
🔹 Admin Features
Upload/remove documents
Rebuild FAISS index
Delete old files and reset knowledge base
View logs (who asked what, when)
Manage user accounts (add/update/delete users)
🔹 Client Features
Clean chat interface
Ask unlimited questions
Gets answers grounded in your legal PDFs
Safe for corporate/legal data
🔹 Security
Passwords hashed using bcrypt
Admin-only protected actions
Logs stored in SQLite (app_data.db)

⚙️ Installation Guide (Beginner Friendly)
1️⃣ Install Python
Install Python 3.10+ from: https://www.python.org/downloads/

2️⃣ Install Ollama
Download from: https://ollama.com/download

Then pull the required models:

ollama pull nomic-embed-text
ollama pull llama3
# or mistral (your choice)
3️⃣ Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/daniyalmehmood2244-lab/rag-local-legal-assistant.git
cd rag-local-legal-assistant
4️⃣ Install Python packages
pip install -r requirements.txt
5️⃣ Run the App
Make sure Ollama server is running:

ollama serve
Then run Streamlit:

streamlit run app4.py
🌐 Deploying on Local Wi-Fi (LAN)
This allows multiple PCs to access your AI Legal Assistant.

On HOST machine:

streamlit run app4.py --server.address 0.0.0.0 --server.port 8501
Find your local IP:

ipconfig    # Windows
Clients can now open:

http://<your-IP>:8501
Example:

http://192.168.1.10:8501
🧪 How It Works (RAG Pipeline)
Admin uploads PDFs
PDFs → extracted text
Text is split into overlapping chunks
Chunks → converted into embeddings (vectors)
Stored in FAISS index for fast similarity search
User asks a question
System retrieves relevant chunks
LLM generates answer using retrieved documents as context
Logs are saved in SQLite
This ensures answers are accurate and grounded in uploaded legal content.
